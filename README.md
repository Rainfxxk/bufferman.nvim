# Bufferman.nvim
---

There are planty of plugins like bufferline.nvim help you check which file you have opened. Many of them are trying to imitate gui editor, but failed to leverage the advantages of vim. So I developed Bufferman.nvim.

Bufferman is a nvim plugin which can used to manage your buffers in vim-way.

This plugin is currently in a very rough early stage. Please look forward to future developments, and I hope you enjoy using it.
